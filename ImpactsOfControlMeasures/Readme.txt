# boxplot.m
Main file. Variations of 6 epidemic dynamical features among countries belonging to different clusters are illustrated through box plots.

# heatmap.m
Main file. After taking base-10 logarithmic transformation, the linear correlations of epidemic dynamical features with control measures in different categories for (B-C) all nations or nations in (D-E) Cluster 2 and (F-G) Cluster 3 are highlighted through (B,D,F) the pvalues (the logarithm to be exact) and (C,E,G) R-square values separately. 

# boxplot-data.xlsx
Data file. Contains 6 dynamic parameters for 127 countries/territories.

# Requirements
The code is implemented in MATLAB R2021b.
